What characters can you use in a R≈çblox display name?  Check the `.sqlite` file to see for yourself.

All web requests come from California, USA on an *account location* from North Korea.

According to the schema, any values where `code` equals -1 means that a display name with three times the character can be used.

For example: I can pick the display name `CCC` because:

iden|char|code
-|-|-
67|C|-1

Other relevant `code` values include:

- `3`: `Display name contains invalid characters`
- `4`: `Display name has been moderated`
